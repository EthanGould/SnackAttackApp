1) As a user on the homepage I should be able to sign up for a new account, or sign in to my existing account.

2) As a user, when I log in I should see the snack search bar, a section to display returned search results, a blank "my list" and a section that will display nutritional information on a given snack.

3) As a user when I click the "+" button on a returned search item, it should be added to "my list".

4) As a user when I click on a returned search item I should be able to see the number of calories, fat, carbohydrates and protein on that item.

5) As a user when I log out, "my list" should be saved for later viewing and editing.
